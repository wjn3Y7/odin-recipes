    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a really easy carbonara recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs and 2 large yolks, room temperature</li>
    <li>1 ounce (about ⅓ packed cup) grated pecorino Romano, plus additional for serving</li>
    <li>1 ounce (about ⅓ packed cup) grated Parmesan</li>
    <li>Coarsely ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>3½ ounces of slab guanciale (see recipe), pancetta or bacon, sliced into pieces about ¼ inch thick by ⅓ inch square</li>
    <li>12 ounces spaghetti (about ¾ box)</li>
    
</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol type="1">
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the butter.</li>
    <li>Once the butter is melted, add the onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the lemon juice, thyme and salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Add the wine and stir as the wine reduces (cook for about 5 minutes until the wine reduces).</li>
    <li>Turn the heat to medium-low and add the rice. Toss the rice in the onion mixture until it's coated and move it around the pan for about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Stir in the mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Add the hot chicken stock (or vegetable stock) about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and waiting until the stock is absorbed by the rice until you add another 1/2 cup.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process above until all the stock has been added and absorbed by the rice and a creamy sauce has formed, stirring constantly throughout.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with shaved Parmesan cheese and freshly chopped thyme or parsley.</li>
</ol>
