    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a really easy mushroom risotto recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>2 tablespoon butter or other vegan butter substitute</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme (dried thyme also works)</li>
    <li>a pinch or two of salt and pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
    <li>1 cup arborio rice (also called risotto rice)</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups chopped white mushrooms</li>
    <li>4 cups hot chicken or vegetable stock</li>
    <li>fresh parsley or thyme and Parmesan cheese for garnish</li>

</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol type="1">
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the butter.</li>
    <li>Once the butter is melted, add the onion and garlic and saut√© until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the lemon juice, thyme and salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Add the wine and stir as the wine reduces (cook for about 5 minutes until the wine reduces).</li>
    <li>Turn the heat to medium-low and add the rice. Toss the rice in the onion mixture until it's coated and move it around the pan for about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Stir in the mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Add the hot chicken stock (or vegetable stock) about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly and waiting until the stock is absorbed by the rice until you add another 1/2 cup.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process above until all the stock has been added and absorbed by the rice and a creamy sauce has formed, stirring constantly throughout.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with shaved Parmesan cheese and freshly chopped thyme or parsley.</li>
</ol>
